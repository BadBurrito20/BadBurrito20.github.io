    <p>Who's my Inspiration? Ryan R. Eaton, my father, insires me in every part of life. He supports my family and I in everything we do. He is a truck driver so he spends countless hours behind the wheel of his Peterbilt 379 just so my family and I can live comfortably and do everything we love.</p>
    <p>He has taught me a work ethic and determination characteristic that has brought me to so many opportunities and acheivements. I love my father and always will.</p>
