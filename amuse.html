    <h1>Amuses Me</h1>
    <h3>by Cody Eaton</h3>
    <p>The three sites that I have put on this page are the three that "amuse me" day in and day out. My love for each is based on my gearhead soul. One being a magazine and the other two are brand sites for semi-trucks and car/pickups.</p>

    <h2>Goals/Ideas for Semi-trucks</h2>
    <p>This site is how I can see new ideas that other truck lovers have done to their own. This site shows the individual truck show winners that have happened each month. Also has history articles, giving the stories of old time truckers.</p>

    <h2>Peterilt Productions and New Designs</h2>
    <p>This site makes me stay up with the new products and designs that Peterbilt has either made or in the process of making. I check this site multiple times a week because I can see how Peterbilt is building their brands and the steps they are taking to do such.</p>

    <h2>Dodge Productions and New Designs</h2>
    <p>This site in purticular, I check to see dealship prices. Not only that there are articles within that give updates on the next Dodge Automobiles.</p>
